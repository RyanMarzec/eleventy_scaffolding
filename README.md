# eleventy scaffolding project
> A foundation for creating templates

This is a project I made learn about SSG with [11ty](https://https://www.11ty.dev/) and templating with [nunjucks.](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)

- This is a bare-bones eleventy implimintation that is supposed to act as the scaffolding to start a project with a large scope in mind.  
- There is no CSS, or any frameworks that create a beautiful site. This is strickly just the templating to create the basic html layout and file structure that can be extended and re-used to create templates to further expand into full projects.

- The intention of this project is to provide the full file structure and templating to expand with any CCS framework or other useful web-development frameworks. 
- Since there is no CSS the only layouts provided are the index and 404 pages. Other pages will need to be created and styled based on the template or project you wish to build.
